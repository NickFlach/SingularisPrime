3. **Hybrid Architectures** - Attempt compromise but often create complexity

None of these approaches fully address the needs of organizations requiring:
- Direct hardware access for maximum performance
- Secure integration with industrial control systems
- Transparent governance across distributed regions
- Flexible deployment and management options

### The SINet Solution
